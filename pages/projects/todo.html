           PHP Todo Application 
        </h1>
        <p class="text-md mb-1">
            This was the fourth school project I made, and the first time I got to try to make a full working web application using PHP and a MySql database. The app used simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions from user inputs and PDO connection in order for the server and database to communicate with eachother. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-3">
            My interest for working in the backend was made clear to me while working on this project. It was a lot more fun to me to work with databases and PHP compared to when working with the frontend. This project also helped lead way for me to work on more advanced PHP applications. After signing in this project I also keep building it and added an MVC system with login features.
