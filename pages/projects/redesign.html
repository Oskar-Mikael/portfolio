                Redesigned website project
            </h1>
            <p class="text-md mb-2">
                This school project was the 2nd project in my education, and the first time I got to work as a team
                towards a goal. As a
                start we were placed in a group 7, but in the end, we were 4 people that collectively finished the
                project.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-2">
                The goal of this project was to redesign the an already made website, by one of the swedish authorities
                of school. We were not tasked to redesign the entire website, but just the 8 landning pages. HTML and
                CSS was in the focus, and no Javascript was required, but still allowed to be used. Other requirements
                included rudimentary CSS animations, parallax scrolling, and a static contact formula.
            </p>
            <p class="text-md mb-2">
                From this project I got to learn more about building with my own HTML and CSS, but more importantly, I
                got to learn how it is to work with a team. Agile project management and Scrum was something that we had
                a high focus on while doing this project. We decided how long our iterations would be, and we took turns
                in being Scrum masters. The Scrum master were in charge of reviewing all Pull requests on our Github
                repository and had the responibility of leading the group work in the iteration. Working with projects
                in Github was something I hadn't done earlier, so this project gave me a lot of knowledge in that
                aspect.
