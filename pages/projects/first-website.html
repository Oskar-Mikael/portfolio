           First ever website 
        </h1>
        <p class="text-md mb-1">
            This was the very first website I ever created, and was actually made on my phone. The story was that I was visiting my girlfriend in Denmark. It was the end of summer and I was hoping to get accepted to one university that I had applied to. With no luck on that, I sat in my room and thought of what my next plan should be. That's when I started looking more in depth into programming and web development. When I was younger I thought it would be cool to write code and create websites and programs, but I never actually took a step into looking in to it. So now, with only a phone, I started reading on W3schools website on HTML and CSS tutorials and downloaded an app where I could write code. I then started to experiment with the different things you could do, and eventually, I had something that I thought looked okay.

            When I returned home I kept experimenting with the website, tried to implement Bootstrap, and eventually added a host it and connected it to a database.
